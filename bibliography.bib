@article{Keesstra2016,
abstract = {In this FORUM paper we discuss how soil scientists can help to reach the recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals in the most effective manner. Soil science, as a land-related discipline has important links to several of the SDGs which are demonstrated through the functions of soils and the ecosystem services that are linked to those functions. We explore and discuss how soil scientists can rise to the challenge both internally, in terms of our procedures and practices, and externally in terms of our relations with colleague scientists in other disciplines, diverse groups of stakeholders and the policy arena. To meet these goals we recommend the following steps to be taken by the soil science community as a whole: (i) Embrace the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as they provide a platform that allows soil science to demonstrate its relevance for realizing a sustainable society by 2030. (ii) Show the specific value of soil science: Research should explicitly show how using modern soil information can improve the results of inter- and trans-disciplinary studies on SDGs related to food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats. (iii) Given the integrative nature of soils, soil scientists are in a unique position to take leadership in overarching systems-analyses of ecosystems; (iii) Raise awareness of soil organic matter as a key attribute of soils to illustrate its importance for soil functions and ecosystem services; (iv) Improve the transfer of knowledge through knowledge brokers with a soil background; (v) Start at the basis: educational programs are needed at all levels, starting in primary schools, and emphasizing practical, down-to-earth examples; (vi) Facilitate communication with the policy arena by framing research in terms that resonate with politicians in terms of the policy cycle or by considering drivers, pressures and responses affecting impacts of land use change; and finally (vii) all this is only possible if researchers, with soil scientists in the frontlines, look over the hedge towards other disciplines, to the world-at-large and to the policy arena, reaching over to listen first, as a basis for genuine collaboration.},

In this paper, simple on-farm methods to determine nitrate-N in field-moist soil samples immediately after sampling are described. The procedures include volumetric soil sampling, extraction based on manual shaking with tap water as universally available extractant, filtering soil/extractant mixtures on-site, on-site determination of the soil water content, and reflectometric nitrate measurements based on test strips. Using correction factors can compensate the impact of the temperature during the final nitrate measurement. An excellent agreement was found between the developed quick-test procedures and the standard laboratory procedure.

	abstract = {In California vegetable fields nitrate-form nitrogen (NO 3 -N) can build up to levels high enough to supply crop nitrogen demand for an extended period. Sampling the root zone soil for NO 3 -N concentration before sidedressing can identify fields in which N application can be delayed or reduced without affecting crop productivity. Collection of a composite soil sample representative of the entire field is necessary to make an accurate determination of soil nitrate status. Eight to 12 soil cores from throughout the field is usually adequate. Sample depth should cover the active root zone, which for most vegetable crops is the top foot of soil. Collect the soil cores starting in a plant row and angling the core toward the bed center. Be sure not to sample the zone where a fertilizer band has been recently applied. Thoroughly blend the soil cores together. Laboratory analysis is the most accurate method of soil nitrate determination, but a semi-quantitative estimate of soil nitrate concentration can be made using the following on-farm 'quick test' procedure. The advantages of this procedure are a) results can be obtained in less than an hour for most soils, and b) no weighing or drying of soil is required, although you do need to estimate the soil texture and moisture content.},

abstract = {Paper-based immunoassays are becoming powerful and low-cost diagnostic tools, especially in resource-limited settings. Inexpensive methods for quantifying these assays have been shown using desktop scanners, which lack portability, and cameras, which suffer from the ever changing ambient light conditions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach of quantifying colors of colorimetric diagnostic assays with a smartphone that allows high accuracy measurements in a wide range of ambient conditions, making it a truly portable system. Instead of directly using the red, green, and blue (RGB) intensities of the color images taken by a smartphone camera, we use chromaticity values to construct calibration curves of analyte concentrations. We demonstrate the high accuracy of this approach in pH measurements with linear response ranges of 1-12. These results are comparable to those reported using a desktop scanner or silicon photodetectors. To make the approach adoptable under different lighting conditions, we developed a calibration technique to compensate for measurement errors due to variability in ambient light. This technique is applicable to a number of common light sources, such as sun light, fluorescent light, or smartphone LED light. Ultimately, the entire approach can be integrated in an "app" to enable one-click reading, making our smartphone based approach operable without any professional training or complex instrumentation.},

The informed choice of management practices for different terrestrial ecosystems rests upon accurately measuring the potential for C sequestration. Numerous methods are available for assessing soil C. Chemical analysis of field-collected samples using a dry combustion method is regarded as the standard method. However, conventional sampling of soil and their subsequent chemical analysis is expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, these methods are not sufficiently sensitive to identify small changes over time in response to alterations in management practices or changes in land use. Presently, several different in situ analytic methods are being developed purportedly offering increased accuracy, precision and cost-effectiveness over traditional ex situ methods. We consider that, at this stage, a comparative discussion of different soil C determination methods will improve the understanding needed to develop a standard protocol.},

%abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly technique that could represent an alternative to conventional soil analysis methods, including total organic carbon (TOC). Soil fertility and quality are usually measured by traditional methods that involve the use of hazardous and strong chemicals. The effects of physical soil characteristics, such as moisture content and particle size, on spectral signals could be of great interest in order to understand and optimize prediction capability and set up a robust and reliable calibration model, with the future perspective of being applied in the field. Spectra of 46 soil samples were collected. Soil samples were divided into three data sets: unprocessed, only dried and dried, ground and sieved, in order to evaluate the effects of moisture and particle size on spectral signals. Both separate and combined normalization methods including standard normal variate (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) and normalization by closure (NCL), as well as smoothing using first and second derivatives (DV1 and DV2), were applied to a total of seven cases. Pretreatments for model optimization were designed and compared for each data set. The best combination of pretreatments was achieved by applying SNV and DV2 on partial least squares (PLS) modelling. There were no significant differences between the predictions using the three different data sets (p {\textless} 0.05). Finally, a unique database including all three data sets was built to include all the sources of sample variability that were tested and used for final prediction. External validation of TOC was carried out on 16 unknown soil samples to evaluate the predictive ability of the final combined calibration model. Hence, we demonstrate that sample preprocessing has minor influence on the quality of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) predictions, laying the ground for a direct and fast in situ application of the method. Data can be acquired outside the laboratory since the method is simple and does not need more than a simple band ratio of the spectra.},

@article{Bellon-Maurel2011,
abstract = {This paper is an extensive review of the research that has been undertaken on near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy applied to soil particularly for determining carbon (C) content. The objective is to determine which acquisition method (NIR, MIR, in the field or in the laboratory) might be recommended for the purpose of C stock measurement with a particular interest in carbon credit trading. For this purpose, an optimal method has to satisfy the dual constraints of low-cost and high throughput analysis. The various methods proposed in the literature are compared. In order to make comparisons as reliable as possible, special attention has been paid to the conditions of data acquisition (sample preparation), and to calibration and validation procedures. In particular, whether the validation has been carried out on fully independent samples or on samples similar to the ones of the calibration set greatly influences the results. Also, for C stock measurement, it is absolutely necessary to measure the bias of the prediction in order to be conclusive about the feasibility of the method. However, only few researchers provide this parameter and we recommend including it as a matter of course in future reports. Finally, although MIR on dried and ground samples is the most accurate method, on-the-go and in-field sensors provide predictions accurate enough to show promise in being a valuable component of technologies that would be used for C-credit purposes. But in order to meet the cost/accuracy trade-off, the main issue using such field sensors is to be able to simultaneously measure the bulk density or, better, to directly measure the volumetric concentration of C in soil. This circumvents the costs of field extraction and laboratory analysis. This is the next great challenge to be met by soil scientists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{ViscarraRossel2015,
abstract = {Summary: The capture and storage of soil organic carbon (OC) should improve the soil's quality and function and help to offset the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, to measure, model or monitor changes in OC caused by changes in land use, land management or climate, we need cheaper and more practical methods to measure it and its composition. Conventional methods are complex and prohibitively expensive. Spectroscopy in the visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) is a practical and affordable alternative. We used samples from Australia's Soil Carbon Research Program (SCaRP) to create a vis-NIR database with accompanying data on soil OC and its composition, expressed as the particulate, humic and resistant organic carbon fractions, POC, HOC and ROC, respectively. Using this database, we derived vis-NIR transfer functions with a decision-tree algorithm to predict the total soil OC and carbon fractions, which we modelled in units that describe their concentrations and stocks (or densities). Predictions of both carbon concentrations and stocks were reliable and unbiased with imprecision being the main contributor to the models' errors. We could predict the stocks because of the correlation between OC and bulk density. Generally, the uncertainty in the estimates of the carbon concentrations was smaller than, but not significantly different to, that of the stocks. Approximately half of the discriminating wavelengths were in the visible region, and those in the near infrared could be attributed to functional groups that occur in each of the different fractions. Visible-NIR spectroscopy with decision-tree modelling can fairly accurately, and with small to moderate uncertainty, predict soil OC, POC, HOC and ROC. The consistency between the decision tree's use of wavelengths that characterize absorptions due to the chemistry of soil OC and the different fractions provides confidence that the approach is feasible. Measurement in the vis-NIR range needs little sample preparation and so is rapid, practical and cheap. A further advantage is that the technique can be used directly in the field.},
